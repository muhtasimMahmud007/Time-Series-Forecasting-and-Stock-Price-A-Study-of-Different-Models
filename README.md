# Time-Series-Forecasting-and-Stock-Price-A-Study-of-Different-Models(Must open the code with github.dev)
The stock market is a complicated and volatile
system that requires accurate forecasting techniques in order to
make smart investing decisions. In this research, we explore the
effectiveness of different advanced machine learning algorithms
in improving the prediction accuracy of the widely used ARIMA
model. We evaluate the performance of LSTM, Simple RNN,
GRU, and FB Prophet models on the stock market dataset
using three widely used measures, RMSE, MAPE and MAE. In
terms of RMSE, MAPE and MAPE, our results suggest that
on average, the LSTM, Simple RNN and GRU models have
better performance compared to the other models, including the
ARIMA and Prophet model. Our findings indicate that adding
deep learning techniques into classical time series analysis can
increase stock market forecasting accuracy dramatically.
